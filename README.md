I have been programming since I was 13 – building web MMORPGs with friends (HTML & PHP) with 1000s of players. At university (2:1 Physics) I spent 2 years programming a bio-ecosystem simulation (C++, OO design).

Not always a programmer though, I have worked in politics, film production, TV & theatre development, and finance. However, I pushed and built tech solutions in all of these industries from simple web apps (Node, Python, Ruby), to finance & news analysis apps (Java). I trained and then worked for a top dev bootcamp, focussing on professional full-stack skills and modern methodologies.

Currently I work for Tes (formerly the Times Education Supplement) and (most recently) for HSBC and Makers Academy. I’ve worked predominantly with the latest Javascript technologies, pushing the following philosphies: devops, agile, microservices architectures, continuous delivery, constant retrospection and developer anarchy, whilst always focussing on releasing value to clients.

I received 93% for an computer simulation investigation into the process of evolution. I wrote the program from scratch, modelling biological systems.
