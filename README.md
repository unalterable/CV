I am a full-stack developer with many years programming experience across many languages and technologies. Recently I have been developing FX services for HSBC’s commercial corporate payments application (JS, Clojure, Java).

I’m passionate about: ES6, Lisps & functional programming; Linux architecture; and approaches that emphasise devops, fast delivery, clean code, & developer anarchy.

I have been programming since I was 13 – building web MMORPGs with friends (HTML & PHP) with 1000s of players. At university (2:1 Physics) I spent 2 years programming a bio-ecosystem simulation (C++). I have worked in politics, film production, TV & theatre development, and finance. I pushed and built tech solutions in all of these industries from simple web apps (Node, Python, Ruby), to finance analysis apps (Java). I trained myself at a top dev bootcamp, focussing on professional full-stack skills and modern methodologies.

Recently at HSBC, our small team brought modern disciplines to a heavily regulated corporate environment. We demonstrated the benefits of devops, agile, continuous delivery, microservice architectures, constant retrospection and developer freedom, whilst always focussing on releasing value to clients.

## Work History

#### HSBC GFX
*DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION SOFTWARE DEVELOPER* (Dec 2017 – Sept 2017)

We delivered a suite of microservices in Clojure and ES6 and interfacing them with a legacy Java6 / dojo.js monolith.

Our team of 6 worked from within the modernising agile-embracing GFX department of the investment bank, but worked to bring their products into HSBCnet, one of the world’s most used commercial payment applications.

I worked in a mordern coding environment: devops, daily release cycles, developer anarchy, microservices, test-driven development and client behaviour driven development, with an ability to write code and have it in production in the same day. However I simultaneously worked on the HSBCnet application, being developed on a quarterly release cycle, with manual testing, and old SDLCs.

#### Makers Consultants
*SOFTWARE ENGINEERING CONSULTANT* (Dec 2015 – Present)
I was involved from the beginning in Makers Academy’s Consultancy arm. I have remit to work on Makers’ education-based platform when not with a corporate partners (HSBC, Tek Systems, & Allegis Group).

A small media (film, TV, theatre) developer, and financier. I ran the technological, research & communication efforts. I also built (and maintained) the company website, and other applications (Java & JS) for their partners & subsidiaries.

I later became Acting Director of Operations during a staff maternity leave, tasked with extensive audit and efficiency efforts in the IT, telecoms, and other office admin budgets.

#### Office of the Digital & Cultural Minister
*SENIOR PARLIAMENTARY ADVISOR* (Nov 2008 – Nov 2014)
I managed the Parliamentary office of Rt. Hon. Ed Vaizey MP from the date of his Ministerial appointment. I oversaw the running of the office, interviewing, training and managing all junior staff. I worked on campaigns such as improving Wifi provision in public libraries and bringing coding into the national curriculum.

Aside from working on digital & media policy, I was given a wide remit and free-reign within the office, so I often used programmed office solutions, developing wordpress applications (PHP) for websites and databasing, and MS access applications for automating emails and training.

## Education

### Makers Academy
(May 2016 – Aug 2016)
Makers Academy afforded me the opportunity to learn professional best practices, surrounded by some truly great programmers. I developed my curiosity and hungry passion for code, with focus on becoming an independent learner and problem-solver. They offer a firm grounding in the principles of software craftsmanship: OOP, TDD, SOLID, BDD.

### Physics 2:1 (BSc & ARCS): Imperial College London
(Oct 2005 to July 2008)
I focussed on computational simulations, astrophysics, plasma physics, and the practicalities of nuclear fusion energy as a future energy source.
*Final Year Degree Project (C++)*
I received 93% for an computer simulation investigation into the process of evolution. I wrote the program from scratch, modelling biological systems. I was praised particularly for analysing great amounts of data, spotting patterns and anomalies, presenting them accessibly and quantifying the results in a manner that the department had never seen before.


## Interests

*DIRECTOR* (2008 – 2017)
