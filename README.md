I feel like I have always been a programmer: I learned PHP at age 12 to make web games with friends; and I spent 2 years building a bio-ecosystem simulator for university whilst most of my fellow students built real-world experiments. 
I was not always a professional engineer though: I have worked in politics, film production, TV & theatre development, and finance. But I pushed and built tech solutions in all of these industries: from simple web apps, to finance & news analysis engines.
Currently I work for Sky and (most recently) for TES (formerly the Times Education Supplement) and HSBC. I’ve worked predominantly with the latest Javascript technologies, pushing the following philosophies: small iterations, microservices architectures, devops, agile, continuous delivery, constant retrospection and programmer anarchy, whilst always focussing on releasing value to clients.
In my personal life, I have been building a Kubernetes lab in my attic, creating a Node.js focussed CI/CD plaform creation tool, to allow for easy deployment and maintenance of home-made applications onto a home server.

As the team's Senior Engineer, I am responsible for directing the dev team's efforts; I prompt choices in technology, practices, and methodologies, aiming to facilitate my colleagues’ work. As one of the only full-stack teams in Sky, we have concerns from host infrastructures to client browsers.

*Final Year Degree Project (C++)*

I received 93% for an computer simulation investigation into the process of evolution. I wrote the program from scratch, modelling biological systems. I was praised particularly for analysing great amounts of data, spotting patterns and anomalies, presenting them accessibly and quantifying the results in a manner that the department had never seen before.


## Interests
