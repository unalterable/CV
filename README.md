# Oliver Diamond
I am a senior (lead) full-stack Node.js/React.js/Kubernetes software developer with an eclectic career in other sectors (although Iâ€™ve been programming since I was 13). I have experience in many languages and technologies - and in approaches that emphasise cloud-based microservices, SOLID code design, devops, CI/CD, and Functional Programming. Recently I have focussed on how to grow dev teams, and how to prioritise business value vs tech debt.

* Current Position: Lead Developer, Tempo UK.
* Specialisms: Node, React, Mongo, Kubernetes, Microservices, mentoring juniors
* Passions: Kubernetes, functional programming, point-free programming, devops, Spacemacs
* Physics 2:1, Imperial College London (Focus: Computational Simulations)
* Extensive experience outside programming: Finance, Politics, Media, Communications
