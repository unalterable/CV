# Oliver Diamond
I am a senior (lead) full-stack Node/React software developer with an eclectic career. I have experience in many languages and technologies - and in approaches that emphasise microservices, devops, CI/CD, small iterations, and FP.
Recently I have been focussing on how to grow dev teams, and how to prioritise business value vs tech debt.

* Current Position: Lead Developer, Tempo UK.
* Specialisms: Node, React, Mongo, Microservices, Kubernetes, mentoring juniors
* Passions: Linux, functional programming, point-free programming, devops, Spacemacs
* Physics 2:1, Imperial College London (Focus: Computational Simulations)
* Extensive experience outside programming: Finance, Politics, Media, Communications

Currently I work for Tempo UK, and prior to that for Sky, TES (formerly the Times Education Supplement) and HSBC. I’ve worked predominantly with the latest Javascript technologies, pushing the following philosophies: small iterations, microservices architectures, devops, agile, continuous delivery, constant retrospection and programmer anarchy, whilst always focussing on releasing value to clients and improving the codebase for future developers.
In my personal life, I have been building a Kubernetes lab in my attic, creating a Node.js focussed CI/CD plaform creation tool, to allow for easy deployment and maintenance of home-made applications onto a home server.

## Work History

### Tempo UK (July 2019 - present)
*LEAD DEVELOPER*

At Tempo I am responsible for the entire digital product. I manage a team of 6+ full-stack React/Node.js developers, with always ~50% junior/beginners.
I am taking Tempo from a start-up to a medium-sized tech company. While always being available to mentor and assist members of my team, I have concentrated efforts on introducing and leveraging technologies and practices that scale effectively. I have fostered a culture of collaboration, functional programming, end-to-end testing, clean code, domain driven design, continuous delivery, microservices, Kubernetes, GraphQL, event driven architectures.
My team have done this while continuing to deliver value - and demonstrating to investors the platform's ability to scale with only small increases in infrastructure costs.

### Sky (May 2018 - July 2019)
*SENIOR SOFTWARE ENGINEER*

Our team developed and maintained a suite of services that allow Sky's Editors to generate and publish scheduled menu changes and then serve it to ~6 million Set-Top-Boxes across the UK, Ireland, Germany, and Italy. As the team's Senior Engineer, I was responsible for directing the dev team's efforts; I prompt choices in technology, practices, and methodologies, aiming to facilitate my colleagues’ work. As one of the only full-stack teams in Sky, we had concerns  from hosting infrastructure to api resilience, to browser comparability. I also focussed on mentoring the junior and beginner developers across Sky – teaching beginners and leading workshops on clean code, and new technologies.

### Tes Engineering (Oct 2017 - May 2018)
*SOFTWARE ENGINEER*

Tes (once the Times Education Supplement) provides teaching resources to most teachers in the UK. The company used microservices,  with (mostly) a MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node), and had invested heavily in the concept of micro-frontends.  Teams and services were divided by domain concerns, and I worked on reference checking, supply teacher sourcing and an end-to-end timesheets application.

### HSBC GFX (Dec 2017 – Sept 2017)
*DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION SOFTWARE DEVELOPER*

My team of 6 delivered a suite of microservices in Clojure and ES6 and patched them into a legacy Java 6 / dojo.js monolith. We worked from within the modern foriegn-exchange department of the investment bank (GFX), making their products available via HSBCnet: one of the world’s most used commercial payment platforms.

### Makers Academy (May 2016 – Sept 2017)
*SOFTWARE ENGINEERING CONSULTANT*

London's top dev bootcamp. I was involved from the beginning in Makers Academy’s consultancy arm which aimed to take freshly trained junior devs and place them in teams with Makers Academy corporate partners.

### Bob & Co (Nov 2014 – May 2016)
*HEAD OF DIGITAL AND COMMUNICATIONS*

A small media (film, TV, theatre) developer, and financier. I ran the technological, research & communication efforts. I also built (and maintained) the company website (single-handed), and other applications (Java & JS) for their partners & subsidiaries. I later became Acting Director of Operations during a staff maternity leave, tasked with extensive audit and efficiency efforts in the IT, telecoms, and other office admin budgets.

### SUMS Film & Media (Aug 2015 – Dec 2015)
*DIGITAL & TECHNOLOGY CONSULTANT*

An independent film producer. I directly advised the Cheif Executive on their projec
I developed and maintained relationships with many key players in the tech & creative sectors on behalf Damian Collins MP, the Rt Hon Minister Ed Vaizey MP, and the Conservative Party HQ.
