# Oliver Diamond
I am a lead (CTO-level) full-stack Node.js/React.js/Kubernetes/AWS software engineer with a prior eclectic career in other sectors (although Iâ€™ve been programming since I was 13). I have experience in many languages and technologies - and in approaches that emphasise cloud-based microservices, SOLID code design, devops, CI/CD, and Functional
Programming. I am especially experienced in how to grow dev teams, and how to prioritise business value vs tech debt.
