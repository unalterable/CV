A man of science and tech, who broke free from a musical education to study physics and computers. After my degree, I got lost for 8 years in the wildernesses of politics, finance, film, tv, and theatre, but always finding a way to flex my coding muscles. I have now found my way back.

After attending Makers Academy, an intense coding bootcamp, I turned the amateur-level skills of an enthusiastic hobbyist into those of a full-stack developer. I have accelerated my learning process for new technologies, honed the skills and values that make a professional programmer, and have come to truly love the developer community.

Despite my experience in other fields, I have chosen to be a developer. In the past I have been driven by a desire to contribute to worthy projects, whether a political campaign, or a movie production, and while I hope to continue to draw on those motivations, problem solving through code has the power to engage me, whatever the project.


## Skills & Characteristics

#### Coding
I am a full-stack developer with an affinity for Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Python, and NodeJS. I also have effective experience with HTML, CSS, & PHP.

I have always loved learning about new technologies. I coded from the age of 10, with lego electronics, BASIC at 13, PHP web-mmorpgs in a team at 15. Somewhere along the line, I threw in some HTML5 and CSS.
In the atmosphere of Makers Academy I taught myself Javascript in 3 days and Python in 2 days. And even a bit of C. I also learned to use Vim, and fell in love Linux and decided to change from a Macbook. I love making little gadgets and widgets, and descovering my PC through the Linux operating system, I even found a way to make it work while all my colleagues continued with Apple.

#### Other Expertise
For 8 years I worked for the Rt. Hon. Ed Vaizey MP, who became the Minister for the Digital and Cultural Economy. My efforts would often span across a massive range of industries, organisations and issues. I have an excellent knowledge of the workings of Government, but also aparticular understanding of the issues effecting the Digital & Cultural industries. Indeed, I continue to support a network designed to bring those issues to the attention of Government.

#### Communication
Although in the world of public affairs & communictations I have always been the digital geek, in the digital world I have been able to apply my communications training to great effect: from better presenting projects, to explaining complex concepts to my colleagues.

#### Teamwork
During my time in Parliament, I capably played every role in the small team, eventually becoming the most senior member of staff. I managed junior staff and interns. I also have experience in a small private company as it transitioned to a medium-sized company, briefly serving as Acting Director of Operations during this turblent time.

#### Finance
During my years in Westminster, I was afforded the opportunity for sabaticals in the private sector. I worked at a $13bn hedge fund, in the margin dept & the IT dept. I also worked for a China-focussed event-driven brokerage, focussing on macro changes in the Chinese economy.
Working for Bob&Co also required a good grasp of financing, I drafted budgets for large projects and undertook a massive cost saving excersise across the company's IT infrastructure.
