<i>
<p id='about'>A man of science and tech, who broke free from a musical education to study physics and computers. After my degree, I got lost for 8 years in the wildernesses of politics, finance, film, tv, and theatre, but always finding a way to flex my coding muscles. I have now found my way back.</p>

<p>After attending Makers Academy, an intense coding bootcamp, I turned the amateur-level skills of an enthusiastic hobbyist into those of a full-stack developer. I have accelerated my learning process for new technologies, honed the skills and values that make a professional programmer, and have come to truly love the developer community.</p>

<p>Despite my experience in other fields, I have chosen to be a developer. In the past I have been driven by a desire to contribute to worthy projects, whether a political campaign, or a movie production, and while I hope to continue to draw on those motivations, problem solving through code has the power to engage me, whatever the project.</p>

<h3></a>Coding</h3>

<p>I am a full-stack developer with an affinity for Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Python, and NodeJS. I also have effective experience with HTML, CSS, &amp; PHP.</p>

<p>I have always loved learning about new technologies. I coded from the age of 10, with lego electronics, BASIC at 13, PHP web-mmorpgs in a team at 15. Somewhere along the line, I threw in some HTML5 and CSS.
In the atmosphere of Makers Academy I taught myself Javascript in 3 days and Python in 2 days. And even a bit of C. I also learned to use Vim, and fell in love Linux and decided to change from a Macbook. I love making little gadgets and widgets, and descovering my PC through the Linux operating system, I even found a way to make it work while all my colleagues continued with Apple.</p>

<h3>Other Expertise</h3>

<p>For 8 years I worked for the Rt. Hon. Ed Vaizey MP, who became the Minister for the Digital and Cultural Economy. My efforts would often span across a massive range of industries, organisations and issues. I have an excellent knowledge of the workings of Government, but also aparticular understanding of the issues effecting the Digital &amp; Cultural industries. Indeed, I continue to support a network designed to bring those issues to the attention of Government.</p>

<h3>Communication</h3>

<p>Although in the world of public affairs &amp; communictations I have always been the digital geek, in the digital world I have been able to apply my communications training to great effect: from better presenting projects, to explaining complex concepts to my colleagues.</p>

<h3>Teamwork</h3>

<p>During my time in Parliament, I capably played every role in the small team, eventually becoming the most senior member of staff. I managed junior staff and interns. I also have experience in a small private company as it transitioned to a medium-sized company, briefly serving as Acting Director of Operations during this turblent time.</p>

<h3>Finance</h3>

<p>During my years in Westminster, I was afforded the opportunity for sabaticals in the private sector. I worked at a $13bn hedge fund, in the margin dept &amp; the IT dept. I also worked for a China-focussed event-driven brokerage, focussing on macro changes in the Chinese economy.
Working for Bob&amp;Co also required a good grasp of financing, I drafted budgets for large projects and undertook a massive cost saving excersise across the company's IT infrastructure.</p>

I focussed on astrophysics, plasma physics, and the practicalities of nuclear fusion energy as a future energy source. Wrote a thesis on the physical and political implications of the atom bomb on the 20th century.
<br>
<i>Final Year Degree Project - I received <b>93%</b> for an investigation into the process of evolution using a computer simulation. Wrote the program from scratch, modelling biological systems. Praised particularly for the ability to analyse great amounts of data, to spot patterns and anomalies, present them accessibly and to quantify the results in a manner that the assessor, who worked in this field, had never seen before.</i></p>
